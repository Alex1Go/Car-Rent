We will provide you or your foreign guests with transfer from/to the airport not only in Kyiv, but also in any city in Ukraine, transfer from and to the railway station, as well as a car with a driver for trips around the city and country. We will help you make the right impression of the country on your foreign guests and colleagues coming to Ukraine on business or leisure. We train our drivers so they are polite and helpful, opening the door if necessary and helping with luggage. Our managers will accept your order not only on the same day, but also in advance, and will provide you with a choice of any transport option - from a passenger car to a large bus with 74 seats. To order both in Kyiv and throughout Ukraine, you will have a single point of contact to coordinate all the details. This level of service is difficult to achieve when ordering a taxi to the airport."})]})},d=s.ZP.div(i||(i=(0,a.Z)(["\n  background-image: url('./rent-car.jpg');\n  background-size: cover;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-position: top;\n  width: 100px;\n"]))),h=function(){return(0,u.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,u.jsx)(p,{}),(0,u.jsx)(d,{})]})}}}]);
