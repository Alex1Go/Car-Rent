We will help you make the right\n          impression of the country on your foreign guests and colleagues coming\n          to Ukraine on business or leisure. We train our drivers so they are\n          polite and helpful, opening the door if necessary and helping with\n          luggage. Our managers will accept your order not only on the same day,\n          but also in advance, and will provide you with a choice of any\n          transport option - from a passenger car to a large bus with 74 seats.\n          To order both in Kyiv and throughout Ukraine, you will have a single\n          point of contact to coordinate all the details. This level of service\n          is difficult to achieve when ordering a taxi to the airport.\n        </Text>\n      </Block>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n","import { Welcome } from 'components/Welcome/Welcome';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Welcome />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n"],"names":["Title","styled","_templateObject","_taggedTemplateLiteral","Text","_templateObject2","Block","_templateObject3","Welcome","_jsxs","children","_jsx","src","alt","style","width","height","borderRadius"],"sourceRoot":""}
